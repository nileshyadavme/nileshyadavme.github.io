I’m a `Computer Science senior at Galgotias University` with a strong foundation in `software engineering, problem-solving, and system design`.

While I’m passionate about `Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning`, I also enjoy building `robust applications, scalable solutions, and full-stack projects`.

Outside academics, I like working on `personal projects` and writing `blogs` to share my learning journey—bridging theory with real-world applications and continuously growing as a developer.
